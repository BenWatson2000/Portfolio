        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">Over 6 weeks, I helped develop a web application that presents information for different Graduate Scheme Programs through a selection of engaging games. Our app targets 3 different career sectors: Software Testing, Technical Operations and Business Intelligence.
            </div>
          <div class="body-text">Each game was tailored to the userâ€™s chosen sector with specific questions and answers to ensure the correct group of people are targeted. The client for this project was FDM Group, a recruitment and training company with services available to graduate students, ex-military or professionals who have had a break in their career.</div>
            <div class="body-text">At the beginning of the project, I took on the role of Team Leader with the approval and trust of my team members. I committed to this role and took on many different tasks and responsibilities to ensure that the approach to the project was organised with effective communication - fairly and professionally.</div>
            <div class="body-text">One of my main responsibilities was to manage each person on my team by allocating them different parts of the project. I started by asking my team what their skills and interests were in Computing, ensuring that everyone was happy with what they were given to do. This helped me assimilate who I was going to assign to project design, front-end/back-end development and testing.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">I was also responsible for representing my team in a meeting with our client FDM. In this meeting I got the chance to ask questions about the given requirements, tell them our ideas of what we wanted to implement and get their approval. As successful as this project was, there are still a few areas that I believe we could have improved on which may have made the application operative on more devices and improved the overall security.</div>
