          <div class="body-text">Image restoration is an issue which aims to recover parts of an image that have degraded significantly making manual re-touching tools infeasible to use due to the volume and variation of the damage. Proposed is a new automated process of image restoration based on Generative Adversarial Networks which is transferable, efficient and minimises information loss.</div>
          <div class="body-text">7 synthetically damaged datasets containing input damaged images
            and target clean images have been produced using two evolutions of damage templates which variate in
            damage type and volume. These datasets were used to train 7 image restoration models, 2 trial implementations and 5 main implementations based on Pix2Pix and CycleGAN that translate input images between
            a damaged domain to a undamaged domain.</div>
            <div class="body-text"> Image quality is preserved using an image processing tool which encapsulates each small input size model and allow any size image to be accepted as input. It was found that Pix2Pix significantly outperformed CycleGAN in areas of colour accuracy, noise reduction, and structure preservation whilst successfully removing dust and scratch artefacts from a testing dataset.</div>
            <div class="body-text">This work provides an automated method which adapts to different variations of scratches and volumes of dust particles to restore a damaged image of any size to its original form whilst preserving image quality.</div>
