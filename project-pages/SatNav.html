          <div class="body-text">Existing road users have recently seen a rise in self driving car technology. However, may not have experienced it first hand and has not been exposed or educated into how this technology works and therefore possibly are a bit sceptical until they are shown clearly that they can trust a self-driving car to take over their day to day travel. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Whilst studying at Whitburn Church of England Academy, I have noticed that the road systems around the school at Whitburn village can get busy quickly and prone to accidents. For this reason, I will simulate road systems from the area to target local users, to add realism and relatability, as they will already be used to driving on these roads and are aware of the problems that occur on a daily basis. </div>
          <div class="body-text">After using my program, the user will be educated around the technology in a way that answers most of their questions and removes their scepticism when even thinking about buying a self-driving car. They will also understand how the navigation system is much safer and quicker than satnav as you can avoid incidents, travel quicker and prevent yourself from looking at your phone to find out about road traffic.</div>
          <div class="body-text">For local user of this program, they may be educated about the quickest routes around their neighbourhood that they may have not known about before. I will also use realistic traffic simulations from around my school that I have seen on a day to day basis. For example, just outside my school the traffic lights, often last a lot longer than others and in my program, this road or edge in the graph will have a higher chance of becoming congested.</div>
