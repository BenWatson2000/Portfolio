                    <h3>Automated Image Restoration using Generative
                        Adversarial Networks with Synthetic Data Training
                        and Image Quality Preservation</h3>
                        <strong>May 2022</strong>
                    <p>Image restoration is an issue which aims to recover parts
                        of an image that have degraded significantly making
                        manual re-touching tools infeasible to use due to the
                        volume and variation of the damage. Proposed is a new
                        automated process of image restoration based on
                        Generative Adversarial Networks which is transferable,
                        efficient and minimises information loss.</p>

                        <strong>June 2019</strong>
                        <p>
                            Satnavs, as accurate as they are, are not always
                            able to tell the user in
                            real time about oncoming accidents, therefore say if
                            there is a car crash ahead,
                            a normal satnav would not be able to tell the
                            driver. However, a self-driving
                            car would be able make their own decision and
                            re-direct if necessary, to get
                            to their destination as quick as possible. This is
                            usually done by tapping
                            into news feeds, that indicate to them about traffic
                            and incidents on the
                            road and detecting minor changes in the traffic
                            around the car.</p>

                        <p>Over 6 weeks, I lead a team of developers to build a web application that presents information for different Graduate Scheme Programs through a selection of engaging games. The app targeted 3 different career sectors: Software Testing, Technical Operations and Business Intelligence. Each game was tailored to the users chosen sector with specific questions and answers to ensure the correct group of people were targeted.

                        <p>The determination of a wine’s quality has been ambiguous for quite some time. This study

                            precision. The purpose of this research is to investigate which features of wine affect its
                            quality for a winery in Portugal to help optimise production</p>
