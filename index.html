            <h3>Automated Image Restoration using Generative
                Adversarial Networks with Synthetic Data Training
                and Image Quality Preservation</h3>
            <p>Image restoration is an issue which aims to recover parts of an image that have degraded significantly making
                manual re-touching tools infeasible to use due to the volume and variation of the damage. Proposed is a new
                automated process of image restoration based on Generative Adversarial Networks which is transferable,
                efficient and minimises information loss.</p>

            <h3>A Dynamic Navigation System Simulation</h3>
            <p> 
                Satnavs, as accurate as they are, are not always able to tell the user in 
                real time about oncoming accidents, therefore say if there is a car crash ahead,
                 a normal satnav would not be able to tell the driver. However, a self-driving 
                 car would be able make their own decision and re-direct if necessary, to get 
                 to their destination as quick as possible. This is usually done by tapping 
                 into news feeds, that indicate to them about traffic and incidents on the 
                 road and detecting minor changes in the traffic around the car.</p>
