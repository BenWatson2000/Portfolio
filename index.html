            <h3>Automated Image Restoration using Generative
                Adversarial Networks with Synthetic Data Training
                and Image Quality Preservation</h3>
            <p>Image restoration is an issue which aims to recover parts of an image that have degraded significantly making
                manual re-touching tools infeasible to use due to the volume and variation of the damage. Proposed is a new
                automated process of image restoration based on Generative Adversarial Networks which is transferable,
                efficient and minimises information loss.</p>
