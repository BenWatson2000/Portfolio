                    <h3>Automated Image Restoration using Generative
                        Adversarial Networks with Synthetic Data Training
                        and Image Quality Preservation</h3>
                        <strong>May 2022</strong>
                    <p>Image restoration is an issue which aims to recover parts
                        of an image that have degraded significantly making
                        manual re-touching tools infeasible to use due to the
                        volume and variation of the damage. Proposed is a new
                        automated process of image restoration based on
                        Generative Adversarial Networks which is transferable,
                        efficient and minimises information loss.</p>

                        <strong>May 2021</strong>
                        <p>The determination of a wine’s quality has been ambiguous for quite some time. This study
                            demonstrates a system built for predicting the quality of new uncritiqued wines with
                            precision. The purpose of this research is to investigate which features of wine affect its
                            quality for a winery in Portugal to help optimise production</p>

                        <p>Over 6 weeks, I lead a team of developers to build a web application that presents information for different Graduate Scheme Programs through a selection of engaging games. The app targeted 3 different career sectors: Software Testing, Technical Operations and Business Intelligence. Each game was tailored to the users chosen sector with specific questions and answers to ensure the correct group of people were targeted.

                        <p>Over four weeks, I developed a web application that allows a user to create an account,
                            log in and enter custom or “lucky dip” lottery numbers and check if they are a winner. This is done
                            through Java Servlets, JSP pages and a database backend all deployed on a Tomcat server.
                            <br><br>
                            Handling data about people or important entities must perform securely to protect its contents,
                            otherwise, it opens the opportunity for malicious attacks. My application used many different security
                            techniques such as encryption, hashing and SQL Injection/Path traversal prevention.

                                Satnavs, as accurate as they are, are not always
                                able to tell the user in
                                real time about oncoming accidents, therefore say if
                                there is a car crash ahead,
                                a normal satnav would not be able to tell the
                                driver. However, a self-driving
                                car would be able make their own decision and
                                re-direct if necessary, to get
                                to their destination as quick as possible. This is
                                usually done by tapping
                                into news feeds, that indicate to them about traffic
